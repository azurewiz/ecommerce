# E-Commerce Microservice Platform

A foundational e-commerce backend built using a microservice architecture with Java and Spring Boot. This project demonstrates key principles of modern cloud-native application development, including service independence, API-based communication, and the database-per-service pattern.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This platform consists of two primary microservices:

* **Product Catalog Service**: Manages all product information. It acts as the single source of truth for product data, handling all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
* **Order Processing Service**: Handles the creation and management of customer orders. It communicates with the Product Catalog service via a REST API to validate product details and pricing before finalizing an order.

Each service is a standalone Spring Boot application with its own dedicated MongoDB database, ensuring loose coupling and independent scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Java 17+**
* **Spring Boot 3**
* **Spring Web** (for REST APIs)
* **Spring Data MongoDB** (for database interaction)
* **MongoDB** (NoSQL Database)
* **Maven** (Dependency Management)
* **Lombok**
